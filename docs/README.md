# Nexilis documentation

Nexilis is a C++20 client/server library with C, C#, and LuaJIT interfaces. Start with the [quick start](quickstart.md) for a first running example and an API walkthrough, or the [repository README](../README.md) for a local build.

## Project structure

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `nexilis/` | Native C++ library and C API |
| `bindings/csharp/` | C# wrapper for the native library |
| `bindings/lua/` | LuaJIT client wrapper for the C API |
| `examples/` | Standalone C++ examples |
| `tests/` | Native, C API, and C# tests |
| `scripts/` | Build and quality-check scripts |

See [dependencies](dependencies.md), the [message protocol](server_message.md), and the [bindings guide](../bindings/README.md) for details.

## Testing

The native test suites need GoogleTest and a configured Nexilis build. After `make install`, run `make test-cpp` and `make test-c`. C# tests also require the .NET SDK; run `make test-csharp`. `make test-lua` requires LuaJIT and runs a local TCP/UDP server. `make test-examples` builds and runs the examples. `make test` runs all suites, including Premake, which requires Premake 5.

The CI workflow in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) shows the dependencies used for each check.

See [weekly releases](releases.md) for automated patch versioning and Doxygen
website publishing.

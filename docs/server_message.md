# Server Message Protocol

A client request to the Nexilis server consists of several parts. This page describes the current binary request format and the Boost TCP JSON response format; it is not a versioned compatibility specification.

## Framing (TCP only)

Each TCP request is prefixed with a **4-byte big-endian uint32_t length prefix** containing the size of the remaining payload. This preserves request boundaries over the TCP stream.

```
[4 bytes: payload length (big-endian uint32_t)]
[8 bytes: client ID]
[8 bytes: message ID]
[remaining: command bytes + parameters]
```

The receiver reads exactly 4 bytes for the length, then exactly that many bytes for the payload.

UDP messages do not use a length prefix — each datagram is a single message.

## Identification (uint64_t)

The first 8 bytes of the payload identify the client. A value of 0 indicates an unauthenticated client.

## Message ID (uint64_t)

The unique identifier for the message (8 bytes), used for correlating responses.

## Command bytes (std::vector<uint8_t>)

The command bytes come after the client and message IDs. The command hierarchy varies by operation:

- First byte: main command type (`nexilis/include/nexilis/command_type.hh`)
- Second byte: sub-command type; both the first and second bytes are required
- Third and fourth bytes: additional sub-command types when required by the command

The server rejects a command shorter than two bytes as invalid input. Missing optional command levels do not match an action.

## Command parameters

Parameters passed to `Packet` vary in size by command. Strings are written as raw bytes with **no length prefix or null terminator** and occupy the remaining bytes after fixed-size fields.

### Application match extension

`Packet::Room::Player3D::matchAction(api, action)` sends room/player_3D action byte `8` followed by exactly one byte: `0` cancels, `1` begins planting, and `2` begins defusing. The room's application-installed action handler validates the request; rooms without a handler reject it. The server's combat callback can also deny hits by participants who are outside an active round. These callbacks are optional and do not change normal rooms.

An application can send a server-authored JSON room response with `type: "match"` and `action: "state"`. Nexilis exposes the parsed events through `consumeMatchEvents()` as owning pointers to the polymorphic `ClientAPI::MatchEvent` base. The `game_mode` field selects a derived event: `"bomb"` creates `BombMatchEvent`, while `"deathmatch"` creates `DeathmatchMatchEvent`. The base holds `room_id` and a virtual `kind()` discriminator. A missing `game_mode` is treated as bomb for compatibility with older messages; unknown modes are rejected.

Bomb snapshots include `round`, `terrorist_score`, `counter_terrorist_score`, `queue_position`, `phase`, `team`, `notice`, `seconds`, `bomb_planted`, `bomb_x/y/z`, `active`, `alive`, and `alive_players` (currently living player IDs). They are sent on state changes and about once per second. Deathmatch state messages include `player_id`, `alive`, and `respawn_seconds`; they are sent on death and respawn. This extension currently uses the Boost TCP sender used by nx-3D; other transports need an application sender before using these responses.

## Response format

The Boost TCP server sends JSON responses terminated by a newline character (`\n`); its client reads until `\n`. The POSIX `af_inet` TCP transport instead prefixes server responses with a 4-byte length. These transports should not be assumed to have interchangeable response framing.

## TLS-PSK transport protection (optional)

The Boost TCP transport uses plaintext by default. Its optional TLS-PSK mode encrypts its TCP connections, including authentication. The pre-shared key is derived from the authentication passphrase; certificates are not used. This option is not implemented by the other transports.

Both sides must opt in:

- `nexilis::server::ServerConfig::setTls(true)` on the server.
- `nexilis::client::ClientConfig::setTls(true)` (or `nexilis_client_config_set_tls` / the C# `ClientConfig.SetTls`) on every client.

Configuration details:

- The PSK is derived with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (100000 iterations) from the passphrase with the domain-separated salt `"nexilis-tls-psk-v1:"`, producing a 32-byte key (`nexilis::tls::derivePsk`).
- The code configures TLS 1.2 PSK cipher suites (`PSK-AES128-GCM-SHA256` and `PSK-CHACHA20-POLY1305`) and TLS 1.3 cipher suites (`TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` and `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`). Verify the negotiated protocol version in each supported OpenSSL environment before making compatibility claims.
- A passphrase must be set on both server and client or the handshake fails. If the server has TLS enabled but cannot build a context (no passphrase), it refuses incoming connections.
- If only one side enables TLS, the handshake fails rather than silently downgrading to plaintext.
- The handshake happens lazily: the server accepts it before the first message is read or written, and the client performs it right after the TCP connect. TLS is applied to both the initial connection and the random "switched" port the server uses for the authenticated session.

## Security notes

`ClientAPI::setMessageEncryption(true)` affects room broadcasts when the client has a nonempty password. It does not encrypt othercast or unicast messages. The message key is derived from that same password and the room ID; the server holds the password, so this feature does **not** hide message contents from the server.

The current broadcast implementation also falls back to the plaintext payload if key derivation or encryption fails. Treat this option as experimental and do not rely on it for confidentiality until that behavior is changed and tested. TLS-PSK protects only the Boost TCP transport when both peers enable it and use the same passphrase.
